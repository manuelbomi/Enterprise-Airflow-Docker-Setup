# Enterprise Airflow with Docker

This repository demonstrates how to set up and run **Apache Airflow** in a containerized environment using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**, designed with enterprise-grade applications in mind.  

The setup includes:
- **Airflow Webserver, Scheduler, Worker, and Triggerer**
- **PostgreSQL** as the metadata database
- **Redis** as the message broker
- **Docker Compose orchestration**
- Example **DAGs** for workflow automation

## Overview

Apache Airflow is a powerful open-source platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.  
This repository provides a **step-by-step installation guide** with screenshots to help you quickly deploy Airflow locally and adapt it for **enterprise applications** such as:

- Data Engineering Pipelines  
- ETL / ELT Workflows  
- IoT & Sensor Data Processing  
- Machine Learning Model Training & Deployment  
- Enterprise Task Automation

#### 2.  Ensure that Docker is running on your system, then navigate to the Airflow homepage and if on Linux system, curl the docker compose yaml files

 ```ruby
   curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.1.0/docker-compose.yaml'
 ```
If on Windows (Powershell), use the following command:

 ```ruby
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/3.1.0/docker-compose.yaml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yaml"

```
